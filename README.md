House Value Prediction Project 
Overview:
This project is aimed at building a web application that predicts house values using three different regression models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression. The application is deployed using Flask, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input relevant features and obtain predictions for house values.

Project Structure:
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

app.py: The main Flask application file responsible for handling HTTP requests, rendering web pages, and returning predictions.
templates/: This directory contains HTML templates for the web interface.
static/: Contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images for the web application.
model.py: Contains the code for training and saving the regression models (Linear, Lasso, and Ridge).
data/: Directory to store the dataset used for training and testing the models.
requirements.txt: Lists all the required Python packages for this project.
README.md: The file you are currently reading, which provides an overview of the project and its structure.

This project provides a simple yet effective house value prediction tool using Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression models. Users can access the application through a web interface powered by Flask. You can further customize and enhance this project to suit your specific requirements.
